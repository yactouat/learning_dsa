    "Big O is a notation used to describe the computational complexity of an algorithm. The computational complexity of an algorithm is split into two parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "- time complexity\n",
    "- space complexity\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of an algorithm is the amount of time the algorithm needs to run relative to the input size. The space complexity of an algorithm is the amount of memory allocated by the algorithm when run relative to the input size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Time complexity**: as the input size grows, how much longer does the algorithm take to complete?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Space complexity**: as the input size grows, how much more memory does the algorithm use?\n",
    "\n",
    "The point of time/space complexity is to describe how the number of operations/memory changes as the input changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The best complexity possible is O(1), called \"constant time\" or \"constant space\". It means that the algorithm ALWAYS uses the same amount of resources, regardless of the input.\n",
    "\n",
    "When talking about complexity, there are normally three cases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- best case scenario\n",
    "- average case scenario\n",
    "- worst case scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "## conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "- `n` => often denotes the size of the input\n",
    "- `m` => any other arbitrary variable\n",
    "- we ignore constants when calculating complexity"
