# algo cheat sheet

The goal of this cheat sheet is to help you figure out which algorithm, among those covered in this repo, to use when you're facing a problem.

## algos / types of problems

### recursion

- break down a problem into smaller subproblems and use their solutions to solve the original problem

### sliding window

- computing running statistics over a fixed range
- find maximum/minimum sums of consecutive elements that satisfy a condition
- find patterns in continuous sequences of data
- find one or more _valid_ subarrays within an array that satisfy a condition
- process time-series or real-time data

### two pointers

- detect cycles in a linked list
- find pairs of elements that satisfy a specific condition within a sorted array
- process elements from both ends of an array
- re organize elements of an array based on a condition
- remove duplicates in an array
